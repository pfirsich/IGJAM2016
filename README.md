# Tron Cruise -- Gesichtskirmes

This game was made for IGJAM 2016 at gamescom. - Theme: **MASKS**

It's a competitive 2-player Star Fox/Top Gun inspired TRON-like set in a post-apocalyptic desert world. 

If you don't have the face-recoginition server running (instruction for setting that up will follow soon-ish - you'll need node.js and OpenFace), you can use w,a,s,d to move and v to shoot as player 1 and arrow keys + l as player 2.

To see how the game is played with webcam controls, watch this video:

For the game itself, we used three.js for graphics and howler.js for sound.

## Instructions
To try, just download a zip of the repository and open index.html in your browser (you probably want to use Chrome, if you want reasonable performance).
