# Tron Cruise -- Gesichtskirmes

This game was made for IGJAM 2016 at gamescom. - Theme: **MASKS**

For this game you need node.js and OpenFace installed (meaning this probably never be tried by anyone).
We will post instructions on this project's GitHub once the jam is over (+ a couple of months of course).

It's a competitive 2 player game you control using your webcam, which is mandatory. 
To steer the ship, turn your head in the direction you want to fly in.
To shoot, press either l or x.
If you hit a players trail, you die and if you get hit by their laser, you die aswell (dying is a central theme of this game).

Apart from node.js and OpenFace, we used three.js for the actual game and howler.js for sound.
